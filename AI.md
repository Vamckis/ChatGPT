## Discriminative AI vs Generative AI

### Discriminative AI
- It is inspired from Human behaviour of classification, clustering, analysis

### Generative AI
- It is inspired from Human exhibits while creating Art, Music, Original designs, writing a story  or poem etc.
- Eg: Chat GPT-3 (for coding, text) & DALL-E2 (for image generation tasks)

## Deep Learning
- There are significant error rate in Machine learning algorithms in image recognition and accurancy in classification.
- Inspired from Human brain functions, researches modelled a computing unit called the Artificial Neuron
- New architecture developed using Artifical neuwons are called Artifical Neural Networks.
- This model has three layers:
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layer
  - Outpur layer
