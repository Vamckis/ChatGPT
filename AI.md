## Discriminative AI vs Generative AI
- Discriminative AI: It is inspired from Human behaviour of classification, clustering, analysis
- Generative AI: It is inspired from Human exhibits while creating Art, Music, Original designs, writing a story  or poem etc.
   - Eg: Chat `GPT-3` (for coding, text) & `DALL-E2` (for image generation tasks)

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- There are significant error rate in Machine learning algorithms in image recognition and accurancy in classification.
- Inspired from Human brain functions, researches modelled a computing unit called the `Artificial Neuron`
- New architecture developed using Artifical neurons are called `Artifical Neural Networks` This model has three layers:
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layer
  - Output layer
- With increse in hidden layer, complex models can be built.
- Word `Deep` refers to large number of hidden layers in networks.
- With Artifical Neural Network accuracy incresed to 90%.
- Below illustrates the differnt networks:

## Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- It is a disciplin of AL that helps machines to process text and speech data and generate responses. It can be used for below tasks:
  - Content categorisation
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Document summarization
  - Context extraction
- E.g: chatbots on websites, IVR based Customer care (Interactive Voice Response)
- NLP has
  - Natural Language understanding : To analyse spoken and written language.
  - Natural Language Generation: To generate responses.
 
  ## Pre-Trained Models vs Large Language Models
  - Pre-Trained Models are Machine learning models trained for specific purpose.
    - e.g: GPT, BLOOM, BERT are pre-trained Text models
    - e.g: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, OpenCV, Detectron2 are pre-trained image models.
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) ate Deep learning Models trained on huge corpus of data, thousands of GBs.
    - They can Summarize text, translate text, predixt text completion, generate code, explain code etc
    - e.g: Chat GPT-3
