## Discriminative AI vs Generative AI

### Discriminative AI
- It is inspired from Human behaviour of classification, clustering, analysis

### Generative AI
- It is inspired from Human exhibits while creating Art, Music, Original designs, writing a story  or poem etc.
- Eg: Chat `GPT-3` (for coding, text) & `DALL-E2` (for image generation tasks)

## Deep Learning
- There are significant error rate in Machine learning algorithms in image recognition and accurancy in classification.
- Inspired from Human brain functions, researches modelled a computing unit called the `Artificial Neuron`
- New architecture developed using Artifical neurons are called `Artifical Neural Networks` This model has three layers:
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layer
  - Output layer
- With increse in hidden layer, complex models can be built.
- Word `Deep` refers to large number of hidden layers in networks.
